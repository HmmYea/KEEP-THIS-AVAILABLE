<summary><b>LTMEAT</b> Disable extensions</summary>

**L**iterally **T**he **M**eatiest **E**xploit of **A**ll **T**ime

From [ltmeat.bypassi.com](https://ltmeat.bypassi.com), if you are interested in how this exploit works, check out that website.

1. Find a page belonging to the extension you want to disable. `chrome://extensions`, `chrome://extensions-internals`, and `chrome://process-internals` are all good places to find your extension's ID (a 32-character lowercase string). You can also do a simple Google search. Once you have your ID, substitute it into the hostname in the URL below:

```
chrome-extension://extensionidhereblahblah/manifest.json
```

For some filters like Securly, the block screen is already an extension page. 

2. Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish. Then, bookmark `chrome://kill` (B) and `chrome://hang` (C). 
3. On the extension page (A), click the `chrome://kill` bookmark (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared. 
4. Instantly start spamming `chrome://hang` (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming (ideally with the refresh key on your keyboard or `ctrl`+`R`). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page. 

If the extension page (bookmark A) no longer loads, then LTMEAT worked! You can close your tabs, and the extension will be dead. If nothing loads, you probably reloaded too late or spammed too slowly. This isn't rocket science! Restart your computer to revert back to normal. 

Exploit made by [Bypassi#7037](https://buymeacoffee.com/bypassi), [further reading](https://ltmeat.bypassi.com)

### "Help me! I'm an idiot!"

I had far too much faith in society when making this page. Some of you skids out there are really, really stupid and also can't read. So here are the answers to some commonly asked questions. 

**How do I get an extension ID?**

Okay, fair. Extension IDs are leaked in a couple of places. Generally, the best way to get them is to go to extension settings and copy the URL query value.

**It says blocked by client?**

That's the message you get when you try to visit a page belonging to an extension that doesn't exist. The error message (`ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`) is highly misleading. Nobody blocked it--you need to find the correct extension ID (see above).

If you got this because you tried to visit the `extension_id_here_please` example URL, you should be extremely ashamed of yourself. Please change and grow as a person. 

**I don't have a bookmarks bar!!!!**

First, try running ctrl+shift+B. If that doesn't work, go to `chrome://settings` and turn on the "home button" feature, then set it to `chrome://hang`. A home icon should appear to the right of your refresh icon in the top left. Use that instead of bookmark C.

There is a version where you don't need bookmarklets, but I am currently gatekeeping it (L). Check this site daily to see if new alternate instructions have been posted. 

**I disabled an extension, but now I can't load websites!**

If you just read the write-up, you'd know that this would happen if the extension's background page loaded and its listeners were already initialized before you used `chrome://hang`. You can double-check whether the extension is listening using `chrome://extensions-internals`, assuming you have a few brain cells in your head.

Anyway, no listeners mean you were too slow. Either you waited more than three seconds between bookmark B and reloading the page, or you needed to be spamming bookmark C faster. The most reliable fix is to restart your computer and try again. Try to match the pace of the gif below: (note the reload) 

![image](https://ltmeat.bypassi.com/img/abc.gif)

**The bookmarks don't do anything when I click them!**

Might be admin-blocked. Either be smart enough to figure out another way or check this site daily to see if new alternate instructions have been posted.

**I disabled the extension. Why is some stuff still blocked?**

I have bad news for you... not all filters are Chrome Extensions. Again, make sure the extension pages (like bookmark A) are frozen before you assume that your skiddy self successfully did the exploit.

<summary><b>Temporary LTMEAT</b> Temporarily disable extensions</summary>

**A method of using LTMEAT that does not require `chrome://` urls.
Works by using 80-150 tabs to soak up memory.**

1. Create a bookmark with the link chrome://extensions/?id=idhereidkimaskid and name it “Kill switch”.

2. Create a new bookmark folder. Name it “spam.js”. Next, paste this link into your browser: chrome-extension://insertextidhere/background.js

3. Then right-click on your folder and hit “Add Page”. Press Enter.

4. Right-click on the folder again and hit “Bookmark Manager”. You should see your page. Click on it and hit Ctrl+C. Press Ctrl+V until you have 38 of them.

5. Go to a new tab and right-click your folder. Press “Open All (38)”.

6. Repeat step 3, then click on one of the tabs from this batch. Wait until the “this page is taking too long” popup appears. This will take 30-60 seconds. If it doesn’t, do chrome://restart and go back to step 2 and add 3-4 more pages to the folder.

7. Once the popup happens, right-click on one of the tabs closest to the right of the screen and hit “Duplicate”. Then, go to your “Kill switch” bookmark and look for a switch to flip, “Allow Access to File:// urls” or something. Then, click on the leftmost extension tab (one that opened from the main.js folder) and click “Close all tabs to the right”. KEEP THIS TAB OPEN!!!

Tips: Go to chrome://settings/performance and turn Memory Saver off, and in the box where it says “Keep these sites always active,” paste in the extension URL. I’ve noticed clicking on one of the tabs from the second batch seems to help with reliability.

<summary><b>Baby LTMEAT</b> Disable extensions</summary>

**Patched On Chrome Versions 115 And Above**

BABY METHOD
FOR THE TECHNOLOGICALLY CHALLENGED.

1. Follow step one of the original instructions to find a page belonging to the Chrome extension you want to disable.

2. Visit that chrome-extension://blockeridhere page, then type chrome://hang in the URL bar of that tab. It should start loading infinitely.

3. Right-click the tab and duplicate it. Don't close anything.

4. Go to the chrome://extensions page for the blocker extension you want to Disable.

5. If that page has any switch, such as "Allow access to file URLs", click that switch. If there are no clickable switches, cry in a corner or something.

The extension should now be broken, assuming you clicked the switch! Only one of the two duplicate tabs should be left standing. You can close your tabs now.

<summary><b>NEW LTMEAT</b> Disable extensions</summary>

  **If your Chromebook has received the 115 And Above patch on the stable channel, Then Here's A New Method For LTMEAT**

**Unpatched on 115 and above**

**L**iterally **T**he **M**eatiest **E**xploit of **A**ll **T**ime

1. Create a bookmark folder and paste the extension page many times. (About 800 minimum is recommended assuming your Chromebook is average school quality) It is recommended that you add the extension page at the beginning of the folder.

2. Right-click and open all in a new window.

3. Close the window with all those tabs.

4. Open the folder in a new window again, and Chrome should hang those tabs to take care of the old ones in the background that were just closed. (Equivalent to the duplicate tab step in Bypassi's method)

5. Flip the Allow access to file URLs switch in the extension settings and then you've bypassed the patch and the exploit is working.

6. Close everything, and you're good to go. If it didn't work, try adjusting the number of open tabs.


Bypassi should add this to his website as an Alternate Method # 2. With this workaround, LTMEAT can endure a longer life!

<details>
<summary><b>Baby NEW LTMEAT</b> Disable extensions</summary>

**Unpatched on 115 and above**

1. First of all, get your folder with 800+ extension page tabs and open it in a new window, for my Chromebook I used 800 extension page tabs as I feel it's the right amount for me

2. Close the newly opened Window with 800+ extension page tabs

3. Click into your folder, and open one of the extension page tabs in a new window, maybe waiting slightly longer to confirm it worked. If it loads, you did it wrong. If you see a "page unresponsive screen and a wait/exit page button," you did it right. BUT DO NOT CLICK THE EXIT PAGE BUTTON OR WAIT BUTTON. (Or if you want to do it fast, you can just see that the page always has a spinning loading circle)

4. Now go to `chrome://extensions/?id=yourblockerID`  Then scroll down and flick the "allow access to file URLs" lever and close the window with the one extension page tab remaining.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Print LTMEAT</b> Disable extensions with printing</summary>

1. Find your extension's largest file. This can usually be found by poking around in your extension's manifest.json.
2. Go to that page. and hit Ctrl+P. A print window should show up, with several pages in the top right.
3. Do everything you can to increase that number. Shrink down margins, change layout to landscape, anything you can. The higher you get that number, the longer the effect will last.
4. Reload. The page should start hanging.
5. Go to your extension's settings page, `chrome://extensions`.
6. Duplicate your "printing" tab, and go back to your extension's settings page.
7. Flip any switch you can find there. Usually, there'll be one titled "Allow Access to File:// [URI]s".
8. Enjoy


**Where do I find my extension's manifest.json?**
First, find your extension's ID. This is a 32-character code found on your extension's settings page, normally near or at the top. Then go to `chrome-extension://your-32-char-id-goes-here/manifest.json`

Credit to Bypassi for the original LTMEAT framework, and HUGE thanks to Swordmaster4321 for discovering that pages can be hung with printing and lots of help and suggestions.

<summary><b>Corkey</b> Corrupt extensions</summary>

1. Esc+Refresh+Power and re-enroll (Enter recovery page), or you can just powerwash.
2. log into your Chromebook and immediately turn off wifi and do refresh+power to (instant restart)
3. Log back into your Chromebook with the wifi off. There should be something on the side of the connect wifi page that says log in offline or sign in as an existing user.
4. Go to chrome://extensions, turn on wifi, and wait for your school's blocking extension to appear.
5. As soon as it appears, turn off wifi and instant restart as fast as you can.
6. Log back in, go back to extensions, and wait. If it says your blocking extension could be corrupted or doesn't appear at all, then it worked (wait at least a minute with a close watch in case it comes back)
7. If it didn't work repeat from step 1.
8. If it did work, congrats you did it.

<summary><b>Extension Launcher</b> Install extensions w/o allowlist</summary>
A bookmarklet capable of installing extensions, for those without an allowlist. 

Steps: 
Go to <a href="https://extension-installer.glitch.me/code.js">here</a> bookmark the code there (Might make a DNS)
go to chrome.google.com/webstorex and use the bookmarklet, then put the icon of the extension, the id, and the name of it (This does not matter, you can put anything), then
press download, and it will work.
**Extra Notes**
- Credit to "Aka, but nice" on Discord.
- DNS will be up soon for those who have JavaScript bookmarklets blocked.
- This will not work if you have a blocklist this is only for if when you go to the web store it shows blocked

<details>
<summary><b> Point-Blank</b> Execute scripts on extension pages</summary>

This exploit allows you to execute scripts on extension pages, this is a great example of how Chromebooks are a piece of garbage.

<i>Getting started</i>
(Note: if bookmarklets are blocked you're screwed.)
1. Go to <a href="https://spot-maze-chinchilla.glitch.me/ingot.js">here</a> ([if blocked](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3kh0/ext-remover/main/newpointblank.js)) on your school chromebook.
2. Make a bookmark with the code there.
3. Once that is done,

 If you have Securly go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/bettergoofcurly">here</a> if it says blocked by Chrome, reload (you have to actually have Securly ofc)
 
 If you have iBoss visit <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofboss">here</a>.
For Cisco Umbrella, visit <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofumbrella">here</a>.
 
 If you have Blocksi go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofsi">here</a>.
 
 And if you have GoGuardian (might not work), go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofguardian">here</a>. 
 
 Now most of these links are a block page(this is intentional) each page should have a blue link, click the link on the page if it opens a blank page click the bookmarklet that you just made and click either hard disable or soft disable, you can also run some of the scripts and run your own code, your extension may disable javascript running on it, so running your own code may not work.
 
**Extra notes**
- I recommend doing soft disable, which only disables it until restart. 
- The launcher was made by me, but the idea was from <a href="https://bolg.glitch.me/_/point-blank/">Bypassi#7037</a>
- If your school updated GoGuardian, this exploit may not work.

<summary><b>CAUB</b> Prevent Updates</summary>

This exploit keeps your Chromebook downgraded (or on the current version) without automatic updates screwing you over. This exploit was found by Catakang#0987. Using onc files, you can convince your Chromebook that the wifi that you're connected to is pay-to-use (like a hotspot using data), and thus it will not check for updates.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58097612/212685932-ef9c802e-6040-42a3-be6e-10997162b7cd.png)

<i>Getting started</i>

1. Go to `chrome://network#state` (on your school-issued Chromebook of course; if this is blocked then ur kinda screwed lol).
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page; you should see a list of "favorite" wifi that you've connected to in the past.
3. Click the `+` sign next to the wifi name of each network that you commonly connect your Chromebook to.
4. The more wifis you expand, the better, but note that they have to come from the "favorites" section.
5. Use ctrl+a and ctrl+c to copy all the text on the entire network#state page.
6. Go to [caub.glitch.me](https://caub.glitch.me/).
7. Paste the copied text into the textbox below.
8. Press the `generate onc` button below the textbox.
9. Once you have downloaded the file, go to `chrome://network#general`.
10. Click on the `import ONC` button.
11. Import the newly-downloaded file.

**Extra notes**
- Your Chromebook will no longer automatically update. (as long as you are on a wifi that you CAUBed)
- Be careful not to stay on wifi for too long without using CAUB on it, otherwise, you might update.
- We cannot guarantee that this will work on every wifi

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>CAUB via Flags</b> Prevent Updates</summary>

This alt exploit keeps your Chromebook downgraded (or on the current version) without automatic updates screwing you over. This exploit was found by <a href="https://github.com/MechaXYZ">MechaXYZ</a>. Using a Chrome flag, you can convince your Chromebook not to automatically update.

<i>Getting started</i>

1. Go to `chrome://flags#show-metered-toggle` or search "metered" in `chrome://flags` instead
2. Enable it and restart your device
3. Go to your network >> Advanced >> Show metered toggle and turn it on

**Extra notes**
- Your Chromebook will no longer automatically update.
- Chrome://flags must not be blocked by your school otherwise, this exploit will not work
- And you must be able to enable flags if it ain't blocked otherwise, this exploit won't work

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Blank3r</b> Reload extensions continuously</summary>

Blank3r is an exploit that allows you to run bookmarklets on privileged pages, such as the Chrome extensions page. This exploit was made with Point Blank as well.

The exploit code is below.
1. Bookmark this code:

```js
javascript:let shim = false;var ids = prompt("extension ids (comma separated)").split(",");setInterval(()=>{ids.forEach((id)=> opener.chrome.developerPrivate.updateExtensionConfiguration({extensionId: id, fileAccess: shim}));shim = !shim;}, 145);
```

And the GUI is in launcher.js

2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.

3. Click on an extension that YOU installed from the Chrome Web Store > Details.

4. In the URL bar, copy the string of letters and numbers after the `/?id=`.

5. Click "View in Chrome Web Store" and spam the escape key. If it loads into Chrome Webstore try again, if it is a blank screen click the bookmarklet.

5. Paste the ID of the extension into the prompt separated by commas.

If you close the tab, the exploit will stop working.

<summary><b>Downgrading</b> Change versions</summary>  
Downgrading can be used for several exploits, to get to a version that does not have patches for certain exploits, such as LTBEEF. This is a built-in feature of ChromeOS.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58097612/212685863-3d6b8ce1-7caa-4735-95a8-8eb6787b227c.png)

3. A brain
If you do not have these, you **CAN NOT** perform the exploit!

<i>Setup</i>
1. Navigate to `chrome://version` on the Chromebook you wish to downgrade and check for your board under `Platform` (ex I have a c3100 and its board is stable-channel octopus).

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88395302/212484378-65e6e6e3-b995-48a1-b229-3265a4993279.png">

<summary><b>E-Halcyon</b> Unenrollment Or Downgrade</summary>

First of all, you'll need a Linux PC or VM. WSL is not guaranteed to work.

Now, you'll need to boot into SH1MMER, and press the Un-Enroll option. It won't truly unenroll you if you've received the 112 updates patching unenrollment and downgrading, but it is still a necessary step for the rest of this. If you've never used SH1MMER before or don't have an image lying around, make sure to follow all the instructions on sh1mmer.me for unenrollment before proceeding with the rest of the tutorial here

Next, you need a version 107 recovery image corresponding to your board, which you can pick up from chrome100.dev. Once you've downloaded the right image for your board and have confirmed it's for version 107, unzip it and save it to a safe place. Now open up a terminal and type in the following commands (make sure to replace /path/to/recovery/image.bin with the actual path)

```
git clone https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/RecoMod
cd RecoMod
chmod +x recomod.sh
sudo ./recomod.sh -i /path/to/recovery/image.bin --halcyon --rw_legacy
```

The script will modify the image in place, and it can now be flashed with a standard recovery tool onto a USB of your choice.

Enable developer mode and get to the dev mode block screen similarly to how you would with SH1MMER, then plug in the USB. The recovery screen will show up, and at this point, you need to start spamming the E key on your keyboard. It will begin a 5-minute wait sequence, and near the end of the 5 minutes start spamming E again. You will only have to wait 5 minutes once, subsequent boots will have the 5-minute wait omitted

The boot splash will show, and you will enter a special menu. Use arrow keys to navigate the cursor down to "activate halcyon environment" and press enter. Then navigate down to "Install halcyon semi-tethered" and wait for it to finish. Once it's finished, go back to "activate halcyon environment" and press "Boot halcyon semi-tethered". and you will be booted into a downgraded and unenrolled ChromeOS environment.

FAQ:
How does this work?
See the writeup for more information

Can the admins see that I'm doing this?
No.

Why don't my history/cookies/etc save after a reboot?
Unfixable restriction of cryptohome. See the writeup for more information

Why is my Chromebook "Missing or damaged?"
After installing E-Halcyon, you won't be able to boot Chrome OS normally. You'll have to keep the USB around to jumpstart the booting process

Where do I report bugs?
The RecoMod GitHub

Why does it say "E mode not activated" when I try to boot halcyon?
You spammed the E key when starting at the wrong time, or not at all

<summary><b>Extension Inactivity hack</b> Inactive Extensions</summary>

1. First, do the Esc+Refresh+Power
2. Press ctrl+d, then enter
3. Will give you some bullcrap about dev mode being blocked press enter then you will go to a newly powerwashed Chromebook
4. Next, add wifi
5. Then sign into your account
6. Immediately turn wifi off before extensions load
7. Go to `chrome://settings/signOut`
8. Click turn off sync and personalization and then turn wifi back on go to whatever site that is extension blocked.

1. Workaround for chrome://settings/signOut if patched: If the link gets patched and you no longer see the blue button, go to `chrome://settings/resetProfileSettings` and click current settings, it'll open a blank page, on that page run 
```js
javascript:opener.chrome.send("TurnOffSync");
```
2. Workaround for `chrome://settings/signOut` and `javascript:opener.chrome.send("TurnOffSync");` if both patched: Just go to `chrome://settings/syncSetup/advanced` and click 
Customize sync and then flip off the Extensions and Apps or just flip off everything except for bookmarks

Note: Before you do any of this do it at home so that way you don't have to worry about asking for the school wifi password.

<summary><b>Fakemurk</b> Trick your Chromebook into being in developer mode while being enrolled in your school's profile.</summary>

**Fakemurk is a script that can run in developer mode to trick your Chromebook into being in developer mode while being enrolled in your school's profile. You can use this to disable any extension, as well as have full access to the Chrome web store and Google Play store. This provides a personal Chromebook-like experience while still being enrolled.**

Go here and follow instructions: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pku_CbEG9SwQtnm0I188RtpdpW8nXQhiNdMp8PN7Mik/edit?pli=1">Fakemurk Doc</a>

<summary><b>Pollen</b> Chrome OS User Policy Editor</summary>

How To Use

- Normal
  - Note: Devmode **NEEDS** to be enabled.
  - Open Crosh
  - Run `shell`
  - Run `sudo su`
  - Run `curl -Ls https://mercuryworkshop.github.io/Pollen/Pollen.sh | bash`
  - Done! It may take a few seconds for the new policy to apply. If it does not apply, press `alt+vol_up+x`.
- PollenFS (RootFS)
  - Note: Disabling RootFS **will** Soft-Brick your Chromebook when booting back into normal mode.
  - Note II: Devmode **NEEDS** to be enabled.
  - Open Crosh
  - Run `shell`
  - Run `sudo su`
  - Run `curl -Ls https://mercuryworkshop.github.io/Pollen/RootFS.sh | bash`
  - Reboot
  - Go Through Steps 1-3 Again
  - Run `curl -Ls https://mercuryworkshop.github.io/Pollen/PollenFS.sh | bash`
  - Done! Your Pollen configuration is now permanently applied!

It works by loading a custom user policy into chromeOS. (Similar to how policies on windows work.)  

Using this we can either disable RootFS permanently or temporarily to load it.  

CrOS does not have the folder to load it built-in, however, the src code is still there so we can manually create it.  

Then simply we just create the file and restart.

<summary><b>Customized Pollen</b> Chrome OS Policy Editor Customized</summary>

**Customized Pollen for SH1mmered chrombook users.** 

The original pollen by Mercury Workshop: https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/Pollen 

It removes all admin-installed extensions and that's kinda a problem for me so this is edited it to make it fit more for SH1mmer users

So I customized this one to edit lots of features  but to keep all admin-installed extensions

incognito mode: on (everything unblocked, idk if extensions like GoGauridan can see)

ExtensionSettings: all settings removed

HomepageLocation: chrome://newtab

NewTabPageLocation:             (left empty)

ManagedBookmarks: removed all school added bookmarks

PinnedLauncherApps: removed all force pinned apps to home bar

RestoreOnStartupURLs:   (set it so when you open a new window some schools force it to also open the school's homepage so its set back to new tab and no extra tabs)

WebAppInstallForceList: removed all force installed apps


How to run

Note: Devmode NEEDS to be enabled.
Open Crosh

Run
```
shell
sudo su
curl -Ls https://tinyurl.com/repollen | bash
```

Done! It may take a few seconds for the new policy to apply. If it does not apply, press `alt+vol_up+x`

Errors

If you have Linux enabled you will have to turn it off and turn it back on for it to work

THIS WILL RESET EVERY TIME YOU RESTART THE CHROMEBOOK SO YOU WILL NEED TO REDO THE PROCESS

<summary><b>Killcurly</b> Break extensions</summary>
Kill the extension by signing out.

1. Visit `chrome://settings/signOut`, the O in Out must be capitalized.
2. Press the big blue button
3. Go to `chrome://restart`
4. Now visit `tinyurl.com/AddSession` or [this link](https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?hl=en&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&ec=GAlAmgQ&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=AddSession)
5. Add your **SCHOOL** account back. It WILL NOT WORK if you add a home account back. This is just so you can still access Google Drive, YouTube, and any Google service.
6. All extensions should stop working.
7. Note that you must repeat this every time you restart or sign out.
8. If your Chrome version is `v112`, this exploit will no longer work, the bypass to this is listed further on. Visit`chrome://settings/resetProfileSettings` click current settings, and it'll open a blank page, on that page run 
```js
javascript:opener.chrome.send("TurnOffSync");
```
And visit `chrome://restart`.

<summary><b>Extention Inactivity hack</b> Inactive Extensions</summary>

1. First do the Esc+Refresh+Power

2. ctrl+d then enter

3. will give you some bullcrap about dev mode being blocked press enter then you will go to a newly restarted Chromebook

4. next add wifi-

5. then sign into your account

6. Immediately turn wifi off before extensions load

7. go to chrome://settings/signOut

8. click Turn off sync and personalization and then turn wifi back on and go to whatever site that is extension blocked.

1. Workaround for chrome://settings/signOut if patched: If the link gets patched and you no longer see the blue button, go to `chrome://settings/resetProfileSettings` and click current settings, it'll open a blank page, on that page run 
```js
javascript:opener.chrome.send("TurnOffSync");
```
2. Workaround for `chrome://settings/signOut` and `javascript:opener.chrome.send("TurnOffSync");` if both patched: Just go to `chrome://settings/syncSetup/advanced` and click 
Customize sync and then flip off the Extensions and Apps

Note: Before you do any of the method 4 tricks only do this at home so that way you don't have to worry about asking for the school wifi password.

<summary><b>OP Crosh</b> Disable extensions with crosh</summary>

1. Back up any data you want before the powerwash.
2. If you're doing the second variation, note down any extension IDs. You may also want to do this if you intend on disabling all extensions since sometimes that will fail and require you to specify each extension you want to disable.
3. Powerwash by attempting to enable developer mode. Instructions are available here: [this link](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/developer_mode.md#dev-mode)
4. Log into your Google account as normal, but immediately disable your internet right after you sign in.
5. You should be logged into your account, but without any extensions installed due to being offline.
Here the instructions are split, so follow the one for the method that you want to do.
 
Disable All Extensions:
1. Open up crosh by hitting ctr+alt+t.
2. Type in `vmc create-extra-disk --size 1 /home/chronos/user/Extensions`
3. Run that command.
4. If it fails with a "file exists" error, then you must individually specify each extension that you want to remove. Move to step 5 of the next section to do that.
5. Re-enable your internet, and no extensions should be installed.
 

Disable Specific Extensions:
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable your internet, and immediately disable it when an extension is installed.
3. Assuming the installed extension was not one that you were trying to disable, move on to step 4. If it was, you'd have to powerwash to try again.
4. Open up crosh by hitting ctr+alt+t.
5. For each extension you want to disable, run this command: `vmc create-extra-disk --size 1 /home/chronos/user/Extensions/{extension_id}`
6. Each command should look something like this: `vmc create-extra-disk --size 1 /home/chronos/user/Extensions/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm`
7. Re-enable your internet, and if you typed/pasted in the extension IDs correctly, those specific extensions should be blocked from ever being installed.

Once they click on the website and press the popup they will be met with an obxniously loud sound (aka a screamer).
